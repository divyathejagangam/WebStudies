        <h1><div id = to_top>A Salmon Belly Skewer Meal</div></h1>

        <p>
            As any experienced cook knows, fat is flavor. The problem is that while fat provides a
wonderful taste explosion, too much fat can overwhelm a diner as the meal continues.
The trick to maintaining the diner’s enjoyment throughout the meal is to complement
the central fatty dish with acidic side dishes that break the rich flavor of fat.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this meal, we complement the rich taste of salmon belly with a salad containing a
fruity vinaigrette. For the cereal base, we introduce a garlic toast. Salmon belly is a
much sought after ingredient in much of Asia, but is not commonly enjoyed in the US.
Here in Rolla, you can’t find it listed for sale, but can get it from Price Chopper- just
ask the fishmonger for it.

            The meal described is filling for two people. Preparation of the meal begins about two
            to three hours before eating, but the actual early preparation work is minimal. The
            steps are:

        <h2>Prepare the <span class = loan>tare</span></h2>
        
            <p>
                <span class = loan>Tare</span> (タレーTeriyaki sauce) is a common base ingredient in Japanese cooking. A good <span class = loan>shufu</span> (主婦/主夫- homemaker) will prepare their <span class = loan>tare</span> from scratch rather than buying it from the store; store <span class = loan>tare</span> has a strange taste. However, here in Rolla, many of the core ingredients of <span class = loan>tare</span>, notably <span class = loan>sake</span> and <span class = loan>mirin</span> are not easy to procure. Cooking <span class = loan>mirin</span> can be bought here, but as any good cook knows, for alcohol, if you can’t drink it, don’t cook with it.<br />
            </p>
                <p>
            This recipe substitutes the basic ingredients with ingredients available in Rolla. <span class = loan>Tare</span> can be prepared days in advance and used for other dishes

            <p>
                Combine all ingredients and bring to a boil. Allow to reduce to about half or less. It has been reduced enough when a spoonful of the mixture has the consistency of cough syrup. Strain out the garlic and ginger. When allowed to cool, it will become sticky like molasses.

Make a space in the center of the pan for the bread. Add the bread to the pan and turn heat to high. Cook for one minute then flip bread. Add second tbsp of butter to the pan. Allow to melt and the bread to absorb the butter- this way, both sides of the bread will be coated with butter. Cook for one minute, then flip bread every 30 seconds until bread is browned to desired doneness. Remove bread and layer garlic on top.</p>

            <p>
                Cut salmon belly into 1 inch by 3 inch strips. Season the meat with salt and pepper.
                Fold the salmon belly and thread them into two skewers each. The skin of salmon is
                tough, and there is no need to push skewers through the skin. Instead, pierce each
                belly piece from the side. Make sure there is a space between each piece of meat on
                the skewer to allow for air to circulate, thereby allowing for more even cooking.
            </p> 
            <p>   
                Fire up the grill and allow to reach an internal temperature of at least 450F. Place
                skewers on hottest part of the grill, cover, and allow to sit for at least 2 minutes- more
                if you want your salmon belly more thoroughly cooked. Open grill, flip skewers and
                cover for 2 minutes. Open the grill, move the skewers to the cooler parts of the grill.
                Paint one side of the skewers with <span class = loan>tare</span>, flip and allow to cook until <span class = loan>tare</span> becomes
                shiny (about one minute). Paint the other side of the skewer and repeat.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Can be served immediately
